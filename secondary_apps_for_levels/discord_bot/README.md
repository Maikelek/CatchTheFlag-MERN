# Discord bot

Discord bot made for **C**atch **T**he **F**lag game. Involved players are supposed to find password on the discord server where this bot is administrator. 

#

Players have to understand how bot commands work and focus on two of them. The first is `.sprava` and the second is `.spravaSubor`. The `.sprava` is saving user message into their own text file. It can have many purposes, for example diary. File is saved as **discord_nick.txt**. If your name on discord is **John** your file would be called **John.txt**. Second command `.spravaSubor` is sending user's text file to their's direct messages, so they can download it.

#

To find password players must find **"MichalPriemerny.txt"** file. They have to change their **discord_nick** to **MichalPriemerny** so bot will retrieve text file of the MichalPriemerny.
